# GitHub Repository Analyzer 🧠

A lightweight CLI tool that evaluates the **health and maturity**
of a GitHub repository using practical engineering metrics.

## 🔍 Metrics Used
- Commit count
- Number of contributors
- Open issues

## 📊 Output
- Repository health score
- Project maturity classification

## 💡 Why this matters
Engineering teams evaluate repositories before:
- Adopting open-source projects
- Reviewing candidate work
- Deciding long-term maintenance

This tool simulates that evaluation logic.

## 🛠 Tech
- Language: C++
- Concepts: Weighted scoring, CLI tools

## 🚀 Future Scope
- GitHub API integration
- Automated repo analysis
- CI health checks
